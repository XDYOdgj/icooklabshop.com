			var commentsList = [{"user":"teresariley","content":"What a fun gift for my 4-year-old grandson! He has been fascinated with \"police\" lately, and this gift delighted him! He especially loves the hat and handcuffs, which he calls the \"lockers\"! My daughter appreciated that the front closing is Velcro rather than buttons so he can put it on himself.I 100% recommend!","purchase_model":"Size: Toddler 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-04 17:07:41"},{"user":"KAR","content":"This fit my son perfectly, it is weird there is no size in between the 5-6 and then jumps too 8-10 but we live in an area where Halloween can be a cold night or sometimes a semi warm night so I always opt for a slightly larger size so I can layer warmer clothes underneath, cuz who wants to wear a jacket on Halloween and cover up their awesome costume???:)My son was one happy little boy on Halloween and very well dressed I might add!! The patches on the shirt, as other people also commented about in their reviews, were really great and did look very authentic, they were sewn on well and looked very real!! The shirt had a strip of Velcro up the middle with fake buttons on the outside, which worked out perfectly, easy on and off plus no gaps between the buttons since there wasn't real buttons.The Velcro idea was great!The belt was upgraded from previous reviews I read, the packaging that the costume came in even said right on it \"upgraded belt\" however it did look like a woman's vanity belt, I wish it had some built in holders to hold like a flashlight or the handcuffs.I had accessories left over from my son's costume last year that I used with this one and it worked out well (yes my son was a police officer two years in a row :)).The pants and shirt were made of thin material which is to be expected since this is a Halloween costume and this costume held up really well, it could definitely be used a few more times before it'd need to be retired.I only have one to suggestion to make this costume even better would be to have a strip up the outside (length wise) along the pants, the pants were just plain thin material my thought was it'd make them look more authentic too.OVERALL we LOVED this costume, great value for the price and excellent quality!!!! Very happy consumer!! Not to mention my son was one happy little boy as well which is the most important factor!!!","purchase_model":"Size: Medium   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2014-11-23 17:07:41"},{"user":"happyday","content":"I have two grandchildren that enjoy dressing up in this costume.They love to wear it and hand out tickets and direct traffic.One of the best features is the belt due to its grommets that allow you to adjust the belt to many sizes.The hat and whistle are great as well.Theclip on radio system is a great idea but due to the plastic its made from it doesn\u2019t stay clipped onto the costume.Also worried that it might break.","purchase_model":"Size: Medium   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-02 17:07:41"},{"user":"pepper","content":"Update:Just bought a second consume (same one) because my little guy loved his so much for almost a year that it is falling apart in a few places (Totally expected since he wore this constantly even at the park and sometimes he even slept in it!).It is very well made and durable and the top really looks like a real uniform!We bought a police Cap that he wears instead of the other one sometimes and people stop us all the time to take pics or ask where they can get one.He's now 4-1/2 and STILL loves to wear this costume as well as his fireman one...this would make an AMAZING gift for any little boy or girl especially if they are into LEGO city because the police are a big part of Lego city.Cute story... When I told him I had ordered a new one to replace the old one he was so excited that he checked the door with every sound on the expected day of arrival...it was due to arrive sometime before 8pm so when 8pm passed he was so sweet and asked if maybe the mailman got hurt and hoped he was OK...he started upstairs to bed and at about 8:30 the doorbell rang...yaaaaay!The delivery guy was fine and my little guy got his new police uniform...??Original post:LOVE LOVE LOVE this costume and my 3 year old wants to wear it everywhere...I forget he's wearing it because its on him so often but am reminded quickly when I get so many smiles and comments and so many people asking where they can find one to order.Kids ALL love it and want to try it on and play with it too...I seriously looks (and feels) like a high end costume that costs much more than it did and washes and dries well too (no special care, just permanent press/cold like I wash most everything else so it gets thrown in with his other wash).People never believe me when I tell them how inexpensive it was.The belt was probably long enough to wrap around him 3-4 times but I just cut it short to fit... its just a faux leather but really completes the look because it pulls the shirt in and he can hang his handcuffs there.There are holes the entire length of the belt so it was easy to cut... no biggie!","purchase_model":"Size: Toddler 4   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-07-13 17:07:41"},{"user":"Leesy","content":"Super cute! I think the sizing is right on, shipped super fast, pricing was great- at least when I purchased it. (A little tip place the item in your cart and save for later, keep an eye the price, the cart will tell you if it increases or decreases. I always watch this and get great deals.)Cons:The star deduction is for the inconsistency of the items included with the costumes as I purchased 2. One came with a great belt that was adjustable and great quality, the other was pathetic like a discount dollar store reject! The hats are ill-fitting and one came smashed, but the kids didn't want to wear them anyway.Pros:Easy to wear, Velcro makes it so easy for kids to dress themselves, the buttons are not compromised by wear of contestant unbuttoning and are sewn securely, overall the patches and trim are life like and impressive. The kids looked great and received loads of compliments at the police birthday party.","purchase_model":"Size: Small   Reviews","score":"4.0","date":"2015-05-18 17:07:41"},{"user":"Beth Holland","content":"I purchased the medium size for my almost 7 year old son who is 4'3, 64 pounds and wears a size 8 in pants and shirts. The medium size fit him perfectly, but what I was worried the most about was the way the pants were going to fit him as he is very tall and skinny. I was very relieved to see that they fit him perfectly and were actually gave him a little room to grow.So here's a breakdown of the costume:THE HAT: The hat fit his head well and is adjustable, BUT the way it was cut and put together is a little weird. The adjustable velcro backing isn't in the center of the back of his head like most hats, but is actually off to the left a bit. The top of his hat is also a little crooked and off centered as can be seen in the forward facing photo I have attached. The only structure to the hat is the front lined with cardboard to make it stand up. The rest is unlined fabric that shapes to your child's head. Nitpicking aside, it still works and the unevenness isn't all the noticeable.THE SHIRT: The shirt is 100% polyester and doesn't irritate or itch my son's skin at all. The sleeves reach his wrists and each arm has a patch that reads 'Police Department City of America' on it. The shirt velcros shut down the middle so the buttons (which were upside down on my son's shirt) are for decoration, however the 2 shirt pockets do have working buttons and function as real working pockets. The shirt also came with a working whistle tied to the top which can be untied and placed in one of the pockets. On the back of the shirt the word 'POLICE' is printed in large, white 4\" tall letters.THE PANTS: These are also 100% polyester and have an elastic waist band which doesn't squeeze my son at all. The medium size pants are 32\" long with a 21\" inseam. There are no pockets to the pants.THE BELT: The belt looks and feels very nice and is 3 feet long with 13 grommets spaced 1.5\" apart. The gun holster slides right onto the belt and has no problem holding a decent sized toy gun, which isn't included.Long review short, other than the upside down shirt buttons and odd construction of the hat, I am very pleased with this costume. The quality of the costume is MUCH nicer than the ones we looked at in the Halloween stores around my house and I don't feel like this costume is going to start falling apart anytime soon. He has already spent the last few days running around in it and it has held up well.","purchase_model":"Size: Medium   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2016-10-09 17:07:41"},{"user":"Boy Mom","content":"I have ordered this exact costume before a few years ago, but just in a smaller size. My son loved it, he played in it a lot. I had to have it replaced at 1st because the \"police\" on the back of the shirt came off on the 1st time he wore it. I need to return this 1 because the pants are used. They've got dirt around the bottom of 1 of the legs and they've got a rub mark on the knee area(that looks like where a kid was on their knees playing).... UPDATED!!!! After I posted this review the 1st time, the customer service reached out to me to see how they could fix the problem. They replaced the costume, without causing me any inconvenience. There customers service is top notch. I would definitely recommend the Dress up American. There costumes are really cute & made of good material. & There willingness to make any problem right.","purchase_model":"Size: Medium   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-09-24 17:07:41"},{"user":"Kelli","content":"Pants run a bit long but overall perfect!??","purchase_model":"Size: Medium   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-05 17:07:41"},{"user":"A Davis","content":"Arrived nicely!","purchase_model":"Size: Large   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-11 17:07:41"},{"user":"M jake","content":"It runs very big","purchase_model":"Size: Small   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-03-03 17:07:41"}];
