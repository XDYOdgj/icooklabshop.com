They have kept him dry and have held up to lots of washing!At my toddler’s childcare, the children keep warm snow pants to wear over their clothing when they go outside to play on super cold days, regardless of whether it is snowing. My toddler was really struggling with traditional wide-leg snow pants and snow boots. He had to wear clunky snow boots if he was going to wear the snow pants because of the style and length, even if it wasn’t snowing. The ones he had were also very thick. He told me he could not “race or go fast.” This was very upsetting to him as he felt very limited each day.I searched for a pair of snow style pants that were tapered at the ankle so they could be worn with sneakers on days it isn’t snowing (most days) or tucked into snow boots on snow days, and also wanted the pants to be warm and cozy but not restrict movement by being too tight or too bulky. Luckily we found these and they came quickly. He loves them! His teacher even texted me the first time he took them to school saying they were great and he was much happier.These pants seem to be great quality, the design is really pretty and as shown by the picture. I love the cozy fleece on the inside. My child is in 3T - 4T right now but I ordered him the 3T to prevent them from being too big and they fit great over regular cotton or fleece pants. I definitely recommend!",

Being wind and water proof is so necessary for an active outdoor toddler.","purchase_model":"Size: 2T Color: Fleece-lined: Constellations  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-10 17:07:43"},{"user":"jaksbackpack","content":"We've purchased these in 4T and 5T. They are the best! Totally waterproof, warm, and overall awesome for a little boy who loves to play in the snow, puddles, and mud. We wash and hang dry. The first pair were so extensively used they eventually ripped, but that's from heavy use, not poor quality. We'll buy these again in 6T next year / as necessary. We size up so we can easily put them over his outfit, but these are fleece lined so your child could just wear them as pants. We stick with pants underneath because he likes to get so wet and muddy in them :)","purchase_model":"Size: 4T Color: Fleece-lined: Constellations  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-01-07 17:07:43"},{"user":"Jessica Kusunoki","content":"The search for the ultimate waterproof toddler pants ends with this perfectly fitted pink pair. Designed with active toddlers in mind, these pants offer freedom of movement without sacrificing coverage or comfort. The lined waterproof material is a game-changer, keeping little legs dry in wet conditions, whether it's a rainy day puddle-jumping session or a warmer snowy winter walk. The vibrant pink color adds a pop of fun, making them a stylish choice that appeals to both parents and toddlers. The adjustable waistband is a thoughtful touch, ensuring a snug and comfortable fit as your toddler grows. Easy to clean and durable, these pants have proven to be an invaluable addition to any toddler's outdoor wardrobe.","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-04-23 17:07:43"},{"user":"Rachel","content":"LOVE this brand. A little pricey but excellent quality and such cute prints. Runs true to size.","purchase_model":"Size: 1T Color: Fleece-lined: Constellations  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2025-02-21 17:07:43"},{"user":"AJM","content":"Update: my child has worn these 2-3 days a week for the past few weeks, in rain, snow, and to fall/roll around in big wet mud puddles. They have kept him dry and have held up to lots of washing!At my toddler\u2019s childcare, the children keep warm snow pants to wear over their clothing when they go outside to play on super cold days, regardless of whether it is snowing. My toddler was really struggling with traditional wide-leg snow pants and snow boots. He had to wear clunky snow boots if he was going to wear the snow pants because of the style and length, even if it wasn\u2019t snowing. The ones he had were also very thick. He told me he could not \u201crace or go fast.\u201d This was very upsetting to him as he felt very limited each day.I searched for a pair of snow style pants that were tapered at the ankle so they could be worn with sneakers on days it isn\u2019t snowing (most days) or tucked into snow boots on snow days, and also wanted the pants to be warm and cozy but not restrict movement by being too tight or too bulky. Luckily we found these and they came quickly. He loves them! His teacher even texted me the first time he took them to school saying they were great and he was much happier.These pants seem to be great quality, the design is really pretty and as shown by the picture. I love the cozy fleece on the inside. My child is in 3T - 4T right now but I ordered him the 3T to prevent them from being too big and they fit great over regular cotton or fleece pants. I definitely recommend!","purchase_model":"   Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2021-02-04 17:07:43"}];
